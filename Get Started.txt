Directions
-----------
Copy the file livecoin.conf from your main livecoin directory (the folder you unzipped) to the root AppData/Application Support livecoin storage folder.

For Windows:
The file AppData folder is hidden by default so make sure to enable viewing hidden files. Example:�Windows drive(C:) -> Users -> *YourWindowsUsername*->AppData->Roaming->livecoin

For Mac:
Your livecoin.conf file should be moved to one of the following directories:
$HOME/Library/Application Support/livecoin/ ���
OR
/Users/username/Library/Application Support/livecoin/

Press command+alt to show the library directory (if it is hidden) in the finder's Go menu.

You can create the livecoin folder before the first run or the client will automatically create the directory on the first run and then you can close it and move the livecoin.conf file.

Firewalls:
----------
Forward port 7999 in your router firewall and/or software firewalls for more connections or if you have connection issues.
